Spring was in Philly - started running again and training for half marathon. successfully completed half in april 2017 but had very bad hamstring and sitting pain front and sides of hip/waist area. Driving hurt and sitting hurt. Stopped running down to once a week ~ 3 miles. no pain after that. Tried to pick up more miles in the fall adn winter but lower leg pain caused me to slow down again.
2018 - Attempted to add strength training and yoga to replace running. Sqauts and free weight stuff, runners yoga youtube vids. leg stretches could have gone overboard. Around this time started to getl left side inguinal sensitivity. not any major pain but sensitive to the touch.stopped strength training and slowed down on yoga. Got some running advice and excercise help from a sports medicine doc. right hip was weaker than the left. seemed to get better. started to run again in Napa. from run/walk intervals to 30 min runs I started exp left hip pain at the top. left lower back pain as well. Started going to a PT and began noticing bulging on the left side inguinal area. also hard lump near hip bone of inguinal area. PT noticed pelvic misalignment, one leg longer than other.
